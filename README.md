# Password Manager with Keystroke Dynamics Authentication System
This project aimed at exploring new methods of how to authenticate a user over the conventional authentication system of entering a password and providing access to a database or an application, to implement this a password manager has been developed incorporating the advanced keystroke dynamics authentication system. This technique analyzes the user's typing pattern by recording time intervals between keystrokes using a
custom algorithm. This unique biometric identification adds an extra layer of security beyond static passwords, which is twice as secure as the traditional system. It uses a MySQL database to store usernames and passwords encrypted with an encryption algorithm.
